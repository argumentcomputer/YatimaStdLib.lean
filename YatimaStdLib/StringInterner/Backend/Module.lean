# Backends

Backends for the `StringInterner`.

The backend is the method or strategy that handles the actual interning.
There are trade-offs for the different kinds of backends. A user should
find the backend that suits their use case best.

# Acknowledgements

This implementation is entirely based on the Rust `string-intern` crate
located [here](https://github.com/robbepop/string-interner).
All credits should be given to them.
